    - tabulate=0.8.9
An nivida GPU with a driver and a cudatoolkit compatibel with the pytorch version is also required. For more details about the environment, please see env.yml.

### How to use the codes
Functions are plase in seperated .py files according to their usages. The jupyter notebooks Demo-Siamese-CNN-Few-Shot-Compare.ipynb and Demo-Siamese-Network-One-Shot-Learning.ipynb demostrate the performances of the Siamese network under different tasks. The notebooks begin with "Experiment" run experiements which are decribed in the report.
